These are the source codes for the visualization. 
The automation folder only include the scripts for automatically generating the essential information which can be directly sent into the Cytoscape. 
Scripts in this folder are supplementary to the automation folder including the JavaScript scripts and R Shiny script for generating the interactive website.
Some JavaScripts scripts were open source project. We respect the copyright of the author and appreciate their effort. These scripts are uploaded only to help the readers with understanding and repeating the experiment. 
We are very regretful to say that the data used for the visualization project was a progressive research. We can not share the original data with the readers. The website can not be opened locally on the readers' PC because the core dataset was not available in this github project. 
Please contact for further information.
